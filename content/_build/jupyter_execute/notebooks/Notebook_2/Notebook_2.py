# ## Introduction
# 
# It isn't typically possible to accurately measure surface runoff directly on a *continuous* basis.  Instead, in practice it is much easier and more reliable to install an instrument in the river to measure pressure, which recall is a linear function of the depth of water.  A hydrometric station is often simply a pressure transducer (below) connected to a device to store measurements in memory (such as a data logger).  We then need a way to map these recorded water depth measurements -- referred to as 'stage' measurements -- to **volumetric flow**, i.e. ($\frac{m^3}{s}$).
#

# 
# 
# ![Hydrometric Station](img/station.png)
# 
# In the last exercise, we processed a single discharge measurement taken using the salt dilution method.  Typically we want to collect discharge measurements to describe as much of the expected range of natural flow conditions as possible, from very low flows in the dry season, to the highest flows we can (safely) measure.
# 
# **Note**: A folder of references is provided containing governing standards for hydrometric data collection, as well as a discussion paper on uncertainty in hydrometric data collection.
# 
# Go through this notebook and follow along with the development of the stage-discharge rating curve. At the end, there is an open ended question that requires you to reflect on the content of the notebook. Written responses are to be submitted via Canvas, where a response field will be set up.

# ## Stage-Discharge (Rating Curve) Development
# 
# The purpose of establishing continuous collection of stage data, and collecting many discharge (flow) measurements is to establish (and validate) a relationship between the water level and the volumetric flow over a wide range of conditions:
# 
# ![Stage-Discharge Relationship (source: Hamilton & Moore (2012))](img/rating_curve_ex.png)
# 
# Each point in the above plot represents an 'instantaneous' discharge measurement, and the water level (stage) at the time the discharge measurement was taken.
# 
# In this exercise, we will develop a stage-discharge relationship from a collection of discharge measurements and the corresponding stage record. Once a valid stage-discharge relationship has been established, it can be used to translate the time series of **stage measurements** to a time series of **discharge measurements**.

# ## Import the Data

# In[2]:


# import the stage data
stage_df = pd.read_csv('../../Project_Data/Hidden_Creek_stage_data.csv', parse_dates=['Date'])
# stage_df.dropna(inplace=True)
stage_df.loc[:, 'Value'] = pd.to_numeric(stage_df.loc[:, 'Value'], errors='coerce')


# In[3]:


# take a quick look at what we're dealing with
stage_df


# In[4]:


# looking at the data preview above, the water level (stage) label is quite long
stage_label = 'Value'

stage_df = stage_df[['Date', 'Value']].copy()

# let's shorten it by renaming the column
# We want a name to be descriptive, and it should also contain the units
# note the Date column is unchanged, but needs to be included in the 
# order the columns appear from left to right
stage_df.columns = ['Date', 'WL_m']


# In[5]:


# import the table of discrete discharge measurements
rc_df = pd.read_csv('../../Project_Data/Project_QH_table_2021.csv', parse_dates=['Date'])


# In[6]:


# take a look at the discharge measurements
rc_df.head(15)


# ## Plot the Data
# 
# ### Plot Measured Discharge and corresponding stage (water level)
# 
# From previous site visits, we have collected a total of 9 discharge measurements as can be seen in the `rc_df` dataframe above.  During each measurement, we manually measure the water level to validate the data being recorded continuously by our pressure transducer and datalogger (hydrometric station).  We validate the pressure transducer reading because instrument calibration is not perfect, and can change over time for a number of reasons.  It is important to measure stage by some independent means before and after a discharge measurement in order to to assess the quality of the stage-discharge relationship and any analysis derived from it.  Validating the hydrometric station stage concurrent to a discharge measurement is typically done manually, such as with a benchmark survey.
# 

# In[7]:


# plot the discharge measurements on the x-axis, and the corresponding stage on the y axis
q_measured = 'Flow (m^3/s)'
wl_measured = 'water level (m above 0 flow ref)'
rc_df.plot(q_measured, wl_measured, 
           marker='o', color='g',
           linestyle='',
           label='Discharge measurements')


# ### Add the new discharge measurement
# 
# In Notebook 1, we processed a discharge measurement using salt dilution.  Let's update our rating curve with this latest data point.
# 
# ### Find the stage on the measurement date (26 September 2010)
# 
# Instead of manually looking up what the water level was on a particular date, we can use an indexing method to directly return the value at the time of interest./

# In[8]:


# measurement_date
msmt_date = '2010-09-20'
 
# here, we are indexing the stage dataframe to return 
# just the row corresponding to the date we're interested in
msmt_date_data = stage_df[stage_df['Date'] == pd.to_datetime(msmt_date)].copy()

# now just extract the stage
# and round to 3 decimals
msmt_date_data.loc[:, 'WL_m'] = pd.to_numeric(msmt_date_data.loc[:, 'WL_m'])
msmt_stage = msmt_date_data['WL_m'].round(3)

# Note that when we index this way,  
# a dataframe is still returned
print(msmt_stage)
print('------')
print('')

# To get just the value
msmt_stage = msmt_stage.values[0]
print('The stage on {} was {} m.'.format(msmt_date, msmt_stage))


# In[9]:


test = stage_df.set_index('Date')
test[test.index == '2010-09-10']


# ### Add Latest Data
# 
# In Notebook 1, we calculated discharge using the salt dilution method.  Include this new measurement and see how it compares to the rest of the measurements.

# In[10]:


# add a new point - get the discharge value 
# you calculated in the previous tutorial
# Here we can enter the additional point for the rating curve 
# from the salt dilution measurement calculation exercise
# set variables corresponding to the discharge and stage from that measurement

Q_calculated = 12 # enter the value you calculated from Tutorial 1
concurrent_stage = msmt_stage # we determined msmst_stage in the previous cell

# Add the newly measured point to the rating curve (discharge data) dataframe
# len(stage_df) + 1 makes it add a row at the bottom
rc_df.loc[len(rc_df)] = [pd.to_datetime(msmt_date), Q_calculated, msmt_stage]
rc_df.loc[len(rc_df)] = [pd.to_datetime(msmt_date), 5, 0.36]

# print out the updated dataframe and see the new point added
rc_df


# ### Plot the stage-discharge measurement points and the rating curve
# 
# The plot below is where you will be able to validate if your answer for question 4 is correct.

# ### Plot a Curve Representing the Standard Stage-Discharge Relationship
# 
# The standard stage-discharge relationship takes the form $Q = C(h-h_0)^b$ where:
# 
# * Q = flow $[\frac {m^3}{s}]$
# * C = rating coefficient $[-]$
# * $h_0$ = elevation offset $[m]$ corresponding to the point of zero flow
# * b = hydraulic control shape coefficient $[-]$
# 
# The rating exponent (b) is related to some extent to the cross sectional shape of the hydraulic control.  Values for the rating exponent suggested by Environment Canada (2012) are as follows:
# 
# | Shape | Value of exponent (b) |
# |---|---|
# | Rectangular | 1.3 to 1.8 |
# | Parabolic | 1.7 to 2.3 |
# | Triangular | 2.5 to 3 |

# ## Curve Fitting Method
# 
# Above, we plotted the stage-discharge curve using made up parameters for C, h0, and b.  We can use a "guess-and-check" method to change the parameters until they have a 'good' visual fit, but let's be more efficient and systematic and use a "best fit" method.
# 
# Because our equation is not linear (normally $b \neq 1$), we can't use the linear best fit function shown in Tutorial 1.  Or can we?
# 
# Recall the rating curve equation from above is: $Q = C(H-h_0)^b$.  
# 
# If we transform the data to a log-log space, taking the logarithm of both axes, we get the following: $log(Q) = log(C) + b\cdot log(h-h_0)$
# 
# We can then rearrange the terms to match the linear form: $y = slope \cdot x + intercept$.
# 
# Recall the x and y axis parameters are discharge (Q) and water level (h), respectively, so the linear form of the equation is then: 
# 
# $$log(h-h_0) = slope \cdot log(Q) + intercept$$
# 
# Using this linear form of the equation, we can use the ordinary least squares (OLS) method to find the slope and intercept corresponding to the best fit line (in log-log space).  The last step is to transform the values back to linear space.
# 
# Note that $h_0$ cannot be fitted this way, and has to be set manually. In this case we start by assuming $h_0=0$.

# In[14]:


print(rc_df)


# In[15]:


# Find the best-fit line in log-log space
# set our stage offset to zero
h0 = 0
# take the logarithm of the measured streamflows and the stage
q_log = np.log(rc_df['Flow (m^3/s)'] - h0)
stage_log = np.log(rc_df['water level (m above 0 flow ref)'])

# find the slope and intercept parameters describing the linear best fit using ordinary least squares (OLS)
log_slope, log_intercept, log_rval, log_pval, log_stderr = st.linregress(q_log, stage_log)


# The linearized form of the best fit equation was shown in the last step: $log(h-h_0) = slope \cdot log(Q) + intercept$.
# 
# The `st.linregress` function solved the ordinary least squares best fit and yielded the `slope` and `intercept` of the best fit line, so we have two unknowns.  When we plotted the general stage-discharge curve above, we set a variable `stage_range` to evaluate the range of water level over which we're interested in knowing the corresponding flow.  The remaining unknown is then the `log(Q)` term, but we want a function that will give us the discharge (`Q`) in linear space.  
# 
# ### Solve for Q
# 
# The last step is to rearrange the log form of the equation we derived previously ($log(h-h_0) = slope \cdot log(Q) + intercept$) in order to solve for flow (`Q`).  

# In[16]:


# calculate the discharge based on the best fit

# ### Plot the Daily Average Hydrograph From the Rating Curve

Note the distinction between the stage measured during the discrete measurements, and the "continuous" stage (water level) recorded by our pressure transducer.  It is the pressure-transducer series we want to apply the rating curve equation to, not the water level from the discharge measurements!

# ## Summary and Reflection
# 
# In this notebook we have used discrete measurements to develop a relationship between water level and volumetric flow.  We've used this relationship to develop what is commonly called a 'measured flow series' (the plot above at right), but it's really just an estimate of a relationship that changes in time due to natural morphological processes.  As we saw in Notebook 1 there is uncertainty in the measurements themselves, and in this notebook we see there is uncertainty in the stage-discharge relationship.
# 
# It is typical that the hydrometric station will record a greater range of water level than what is captured during site visits when discrete discharge measurements are taken.  This is because the hydrometric station is installed and left running to measure water level 'continuously' (at some frequency, such as 2 minutes or 15 minutes) for years at a time.  In many cases it isn't practical or cost effective to make more than three or four visits per year to the station to collect measurements, download stage data, check datalogger batteries, etc.  As a result, it is typical to have discrete discharge measurements over a narrower range of flow conditions than is measured by the hydrometric station, so our 'measured flow series' then must *extrapolate* from the range of conditions we have actually taken discrete measurements for.  
# 
# The 'measured flow series' is used in many applications in resource engineering.  Low flows are used to determine natural or baseline conditions for fish habitat impact assessments, high flows are used to size hydraulic structures, such as dam spillways.  Hydrometric stations are often installed in new locations to support projects that have multi-decade planning horizons.  
# 
# ## Questions for Reflection
# 
# Ultimately, the rating curve and measured discharge series are used to characterize a water resource to support decisions in policy and design.  In characterizing a water resource, not only is it common to extrapolate beyond the range of measured conditions, it is necessary to extrapolate into the future.  
# 
# Provide a brief discussion (1-2 paragraphs) describing how your confidence in the flow predicted by the rating curve changes as a function of water level?  Compare your level of confidence in the rating curve accurately predicting flow tomorrow, versus one year from now, versus ten years from now.  How might these concerns be addressed?
