# # Notebook 1: Flow Measurement using the Salt Dilution Method
# 
# Follow along in this notebook to learn about the salt dilution method for measuring streamflow.  At the end, there is an open ended question that requires you to reflect on the content of the notebook.  Written responses are to be submitted via Canvas, where a response field will be set up.

# ### Given Information:

# *(an example of a nicely formatted table using the Markdown notation)*

# ## Temperature Correction for Conductivity
# 
# The electrical conductivity (EC) of water is a function of temperature, so it is important that the water used for calibration is the same temperature as the water in the stream being measured.  Alternatively, a temperature correction can be applied.
# 
# Presented below are two different methods of temperature compensation.
# 
# The instrument used in both the calibration and the measurement already has temperature compensation within the instrument, so the values recorded are EC at 25 C.

# ## Plot the calibration and best fit line
# 
# The calibration points are plotted with as red circles, which is represented in the call to the `plot` function by the two-character combination `ro`.  The best fit line through the calibration points is represented by a dashed blue line, specified by the three character code `b--`.  Changing the appearance of the plotted series is a matter of [looking up the short form](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.0/api/markers_api.html#module-matplotlib.markers).  
# 
# The `stats.linregress` function takes in two arrays and returns the equation of the best fit line through the data, along with information about the fit.  Note that the r-value is the correlation coefficient.  The coefficient of determination ($R^2$) is the correlation coefficient squared.

# ### Alternative Plotting Library for Interactivity: Bokeh
# 
# If you can imagine a function or feature you wish were already built, chances are it exists.  The Bokeh plotting library allows for a higher level of interactivity.  In the plot below, note the toolbar on the right hand side.  You can use the tools to take a closer look at your data in this simple case.  Plots can also be linked in Bokeh, with which powerful 'dashboards' can be built.  

# In[10]:


from bokeh.plotting import figure, show, output_notebook
# specify the plot to output within the notebook and not in a new window
output_notebook()

# initialize the figure
p = figure(plot_width=800, plot_height=400)

# add a circle renderer with a size, color, and alpha
p.circle(cond_series, conc_series, size=5, color="red", alpha=0.5)
p.line(x_range, best_fit)

show(p)


# ### Best Fit slope and R<sup>2</sup> of calibration points
# 
# Below, the print statement is comprised of a string.  In ths string, the `{}` symbols appear twice where I want to insert input from two different variables.  In this case, the values inside the curly brackets `{:.2f}` means I want a **float** of **2** decimal places.  There are a number of ways to insert variable values in strings for output.  More information on string formatting can be [found here](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3101/).
# 
# The `\n` in the string breaks the line in the printed output.

# In[11]:


#note: the number of decimals in the slope is too low. adjust the line below to print one more decimal.

# ### Plot the salt dilution measurement
# 
# Now we'll use the second data file.  Recall that the first file was for calibration.  The EC sensor was placed in a measured volume of water, and calibration solution was added in measured amounts to record the change in conductivity.  
# 
# For the actual measurement of flow in the creek, the EC sensor is placed in the creek some distance downstream of the where a known mass of salt is deposited and mixed.
# 
# Below we plot the conductivity over time, and we also determine what the 'background' conductivity was in order to calculate the area under the conductivity curve.  It turns out there is a lot of interesting information about runoff processes contained in the background EC signal.

# ## Calculate Discharge
# 
# The volumetric flow (discharge) is equal to the area under the salt dilution curve, minus the background EC.
# 
# Calculate the area under the curve:
# 
# The area is: $$A_{curve} = \sum_{i=start}^{end} (ECT_i - ECT_{BG,i}) \cdot Slope_{calibration} \cdot t_{step,i} = \frac{\mu S}{cm} \cdot \frac {mg/L}{\mu S/cm} \cdot s = \frac {mg}{L} \cdot s$$
# Then discharge (Q) is calculated by: $\frac{m_{salt}}{A_{curve}} = \frac{M\cdot kg \cdot \frac{1x10^6 mg}{1kg}}{\frac {mg}{L} \cdot \frac{1000 L}{1m^3} \cdot s} = \frac {m^3}{s}$
# 
# To illustrate, we are calculating the total area under the curve:
# 
# ![Area under conductivity curve](img/a1.png)
# 
# And we are subtracting the rectangle representing the background.
# 
# ![Background Area](img/a2.png)
# 

# In the cell below, we are calculating the area under the conductivity curve (`ECT (uS/cm`) and subtracting our background average determined above. 
# 
# Change the calculation so it only takes into account the part of the wave between the start and stop markers, i.e. `msmt_start` and `msmt_stop`.  
# 
# *Hint, how was the background average (`background_ect`) calculated previously?* 

# In[17]:


sd_data['t_elapsed'] = sd_data['Time (s)']

# subtract the background and multiply by the calibration slope 
sd_data['Concentration'] = (sd_data['ECT (uS/cm)'] - background_ect) * slope

time_step = 1 # the time step of the EC measurement device is 1s


# In[18]:


# trim the time series to the start and end time
msmt_slice = sd_data[(sd_data['Time (s)'] > msmt_start) & (sd_data['Time (s)'] < msmt_end)].copy()

# approximating the area under the curve as the sum of small rectangles
# of height 'concentration' and widths of 1 time step (1 second in this case)
concentration_area = sum(msmt_slice['Concentration'] * time_step)


# In[19]:


mass = 1 # 1 kg salt was dumped in the river

# see the section above to convince yourself the units work out.
Q_calculated = mass * 1000 / concentration_area

print('The calculated discharge for the measurement is {:.2f} m^3/s'.format(Q_calculated))


# ## Questions to Consider
# 
# In this notebook, we demonstrated how a salt dilution measurement is processed, including calibration and calculation of volumetric flow.  There are a number of sources of uncertainty in this process.  Provide short written responses to the questions below.  It is recommended to use this notebook to get a sense of the sensitivity of the resulting volumetric flow calculation to various input parameters.
# 
# * Near the start of the notebook, we set variables associated with the calibration of the EC sensor:  
#  * `cal_vol`: the volume of water from the stream used as the baseline for calibration,
#  * `cal_solution_concn`: the concentration of our calibration solution, and 
#  * `cal_vol_increment`: the incremental volume of calibration solution added to the calibration volume
#  
# ### Question 1: 
# 
# Comment on the effect of errors in the *accuracy* of the three calibration variables.  Which variable results in the greatest change to the calculated discharge if the variable is changed by +/- 10%?
# 
# (i.e. what happens to the calculated discharge if our calibration solution is off by 1 mg/L?  What happens if we mislabel the container and instead of 10.1 mg/L we write 100.1 mg/L?)
# 
# ### Question 2: 
# 
# Above, we manually set the start and end of the salt injection measurement (marked in the plot by the green dots) using the `msmt_start` and `msmt_end` variables.  In some flow conditions, the EC reading will take a very long time to return to baseline.  The realities of field work (time constraints, battery power, etc) occassionally result in the 'tail' of the measurement curve being cut off.  What happens to the calculated discharge if the EC measurement stops unexpectedly before the EC returns to baseline?  Go back in the notebook and change the `msmt_end` time and comment on the effect on the calculated discharge.
